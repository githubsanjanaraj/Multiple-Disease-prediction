# Multiple-Disease-prediction
Our project uses ML to improve early detection of diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson’s. We compare SVM and logistic regression models and deploy them with Streamlit. Using anonymized and synthetic data, we ensure privacy, scalability, and real-time analytics to support better healthcare outcomes.
